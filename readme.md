[Play the game in-browser here on itch.io!](https://jakeoreilly.itch.io/flingsort) ⬅️

### ❔How to Play
- The only control is Left-Mouse Button, use this to click on an item, it'll fly the other way!
- Your Score is the big 3 digits.
- When you've been wrong 4 times, your final score is shown, but you can keep playing!
- The Round progresses every 5 Points.
- Every Round chooses a new Category Pair.
- Certain Rounds introduce new items,  or let you have more items on screen at once (Better get juggling!).
- The game stops changing at Round 15 (75 Points, Good luck!).

### 📠footnote
this is the first game i've actually considered "finished", and my first publicly uploaded one! my personal best is 65 :p (while i was setting up this page...).

it was also made for the Kenney Jam 2024, and even though this is my first finished gamejam game, i did the challenges of mouse-only-controls and use-only-one-asset-pack!

the theme was Connection, so my reasoning is you have to connect the item to the right category, and the mouse has to connect with the item to fling it lol
